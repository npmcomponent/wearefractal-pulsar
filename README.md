Pulsar uses ES5 features so be sure to include es5shim on your page.

## Example

### Server

```javascript
var Pulsar = require('pulsar');
var server = http.createServer().listen(8080);
var pulse = Pulsar.createServer(server);

channel = pulse.channel('test');
channel.on('ping', function (num) {
  channel.emit('pong', num);
});
```

### Client

```javascript
var pulse = Pulsar.createClient();
channel = pulse.channel('test');
channel.emit('ping', 2);
channel.on('pong', function(num){
  // num === 2
});
```

## Server Usage

### Create

```
-- Options --
resource - change to allow multiple servers on one port (default: "default")
```

```javascript
var Pulsar = require('pulsar');
var pulse = Pulsar.createServer(httpServer, {options});
```

## Client Usage

### Create

```
-- Options --
host - server location (default: window.location.hostname)
port - server port (default: window.location.port)
secure - use SSL (default: window.location.protocol)
resource - change to allow multiple servers on one port (default: "default")
```

```javascript
var pulse = Pulsar.createClient({options});
```

## Middleware

Middleware can be added to intercept or cancel inbound events. Syntax is the same on the client and server.

```javascript
channel.use(function(emit, event, args...){
  if (event === 'login') {
    emit(); // Send the event on its way, emit with the same args
  } else {
    emit(1, 2, 3); // Send the event on its way, emit with new args
  }
  // Don't call emit and the event will be cancelled
});
```
